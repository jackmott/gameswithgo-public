The great artists of the Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup team have recently enhanced and added to the already-amazing set with this supplemental collection of tiles: even more spells, effects, monsters, items, GUI elements, player avatars, terrain, and dungeon features.

Have you ever played Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup? You should. Seriously, it's a great game. These tiles are a collaborative effort of many artists. See
